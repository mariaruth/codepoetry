Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

 Surely some revelation is at hand;
 
 Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
 
 The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
 
 When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
 
 Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
 
 A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
 
 A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
 
 Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
 
 Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
